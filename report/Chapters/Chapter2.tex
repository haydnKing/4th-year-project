\lhead{Chapter 2. \emph{HMMs} }

\section{Mathematical Description}

A description of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) - a Markov Model whose internal
state is unknown, but which emits a symbol from an alphabet with a distribution
dependant on the state.

%\subsection{Subsection 2}

\section{Use for Gene Prediction}

A description of how HMMs have been successfully used to predict genes in a
number of studies.

\section{Use for Promoter Discovery}

How HMMs can also be used to score putative promoter regions, and how this is
distinct from the case with genes.

\section{Implementation}

A description of the implementation and the algorithms required for HMMs,
including:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Training the model transition and emission probabilities from a data
    set
  \item Efficiently representing an HMM in memory
  \item Calculating a score for a sequence given a set of transition and
    emission probabilities
  \item Choosing a decision threshold for promoter regions
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}

Results of the HMM implementation, both in \emph{Marchantia} and on test
genomes (where promoter annotation data is already available).
