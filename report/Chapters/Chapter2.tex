\section{Hidden Markov Models}
\label{sec:HMMs} 

\subsection{Mathematical Description}
\label{ssec:hmm_desc}

A description of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) - a Markov Model whose internal
state is unknown, but which emits a symbol from an alphabet with a distribution
dependant on the state.

\subsection{Use in Bioinformatics}
\label{ssec:hmms_bioinformatics}

A description of how HMMs have been successfully used to predict genes in a
number of studies.

\subsection{HMMER}
\label{ssec:hmmer}

A description of the HMMER implementation and the algorithms required for HMMs,
including:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Training the model transition and emission probabilities from a data
    set
  \item Efficiently representing an HMM in memory
  \item Calculating a score for a sequence given a set of transition and
    emission probabilities
  \item Choosing a decision threshold for promoter regions
\end{itemize}

Also discuss the limitations of the HMMER software for scripting and its vast
memory use issues.

\section{The PPR Family}
\label{sec:review_PPR}

Discuss detection/prediction vs extraction. 
Introduce references.

\subsection{In \emph{A. Thaliana}}
\label{ssec:pprs_ara}

Explain the development of the PPR detection routine for Arabidopsis, as well
as why Arabidopsis made a good test organism.
Compare directly with the paper about this.
