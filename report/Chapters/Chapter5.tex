\section{Summary of the Work}

Brief summary of each section, draw together the survey and simulation threads
and emphasise the potential importance for SynBio

\section{Future Work and Directions}

binding rules, details of the molecular interactions causing increased or
reduced translation and degradation, or of the mechanism or true purpose of RNA
editing.
