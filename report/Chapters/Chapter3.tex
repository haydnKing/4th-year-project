\chapter{Automating PPR discovery} 
\label{chap:methods}

A brief overview of extraction and comparison

\section{Automated PPR Detection and Extraction}
\label{sec:ppr_extraction}

Introduce the problems of detection and extraction.

\subsection{pyHMMER}
\label{ssec:pyHMMER}

Explain the need for a HMMER wrapper and discuss the development of pyHMMER,
drawing attention to the github repo.

\subsection{Detection, Extraction and Annotation}
\label{ssec:Detection}

How to spot a chain of PPR repeats


\subsection{Comparison to Existing Data}
\label{sseq:comparison}

Compare the number of PPRs found to those found in the paper in arabidopsis.

\subsection{Expansion to Other Plants}
\label{ssec:pprs_other}

Discuss the expansion to other plants, and the problems faced (larger genomes,
bugs in HMMER).

\section{Predicting PPR Binding regions}
\label{sec:ppr_binding_prediction}

Introduce the problem and the data available.

\subsection{Direct HMMs}
\label{sec:hmm_binding}

Explain this method and why it failed

\subsection{Direct PSSM}
\label{sec:pssm_binding}

Explain why this method was more successful, but why it fails to recognise a
precise binding region and how this problem was overcome.

\subsection{Comparison of PSSMs}
\label{sec:pssm_comparison}

Explain the method, its strengths and its limitations.
