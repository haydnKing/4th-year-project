abstract = {The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) is a helical repeat motif found in an exceptionally large family of RNA-binding proteins that functions in mitochondrial and chloroplast gene expression. PPR proteins harbor between 2 and 30 repeats and typically bind single-stranded RNA in a sequence-specific fashion. However, the basis for sequence-specific RNA recognition by PPR tracts has been unknown. We used computational methods to infer a code for nucleotide recognition involving two amino acids in each repeat, and we validated this model by recoding a PPR protein to bind novel RNA sequences in vitro. Our results show that PPR tracts bind RNA via a modular recognition mechanism that differs from previously described RNA-protein recognition modes and that underpins a natural library of specific protein/RNA partners of unprecedented size and diversity. These findings provide a significant step toward the prediction of native binding sites of the enormous number of PPR proteins found in nature. Furthermore, the extraordinary evolutionary plasticity of the PPR family suggests that the PPR scaffold will be particularly amenable to redesign for new sequence specificities and functions.},

abstract = {The expressions of chloroplast and mitochondria genes are tightly controlled by numerous nuclear-encoded proteins, mainly at the post-transcriptional level. Recent analyses have identified a large, plant-specific family of pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motif-containing proteins that are exclusively involved in RNA metabolism of organelle genes via sequence-specific RNA binding. A tandem array of PPR motifs within the protein is believed to facilitate the RNA interaction, although little is known of the mechanism. Here, we describe the RNA interacting framework of a PPR protein, Arabidopsis HCF152. First, we demonstrated that a Pfam model could be relevant to the PPR motif function. A series of proteins with two PPR motifs showed significant differences in their RNA binding affinities, indicating functional differences among PPR motifs. Mutagenesis and informatics analysis putatively identified five amino acids organizing its RNA binding surface [the 1st, 4th, 8th, 12th and 'ii'(-2nd) amino acids] and their complex connections. SELEX (Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) and nucleobase preference assays determined the nucleobases with high affinity for HCF152 and suggested several characteristic amino acids that may be involved in determining specificity and/or affinity of the PPR/RNA interaction.},

@article{Okuda2012,
abstract = {In plant organelles, RNA editing alters specific cytidine residues to uridine in transcripts. All of the site-specificity factors of RNA editing identified so far are pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins. A defect in a specific PPR protein often impairs RNA editing at multiple sites, at which the cis-acting elements are not highly conserved. The molecular mechanism for sharing a single PPR protein over multiple sites is still unclear. We focused here on the PPR proteins OTP82 and CRR22, the putative target elements of which are, respectively, partially and barely conserved. Recombinant OTP82 specifically bound to the -15 to 0 regions of its target sites. Recombinant CRR22 specifically bound to the -20 to 0 regions of the ndhB-7 and ndhD-5 sites and to the -17 to 0 region of the rpoB-3 site. Taking this information together with the genetic data, we conclude that OTP82 and CRR22 act as site-specificity factors at multiple sites in plastids. In addition, the high-affinity binding of CRR22 to unrelated cis-acting elements suggests that only certain specific nucleotides in a cis-acting element are sufficient for high-affinity binding of a PPR protein. The cis-acting elements can therefore be rather divergent and still be recognized by a single PPR protein.},

abstract = {Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins comprise a large family of helical repeat proteins that bind RNA and modulate organellar RNA metabolism. The mechanisms underlying the functions attributed to PPR proteins are unknown. We describe in vitro studies of the maize protein PPR10 that clarify how PPR10 modulates the stability and translation of specific chloroplast mRNAs. We show that recombinant PPR10 bound to its native binding site in the chloroplast atpI-atpH intergenic region (i) blocks both 5'→3' and 3'→ 5 exoribonucleases in vitro; (ii) is sufficient to define the native processed atpH mRNA 5'-terminus in conjunction with a generic 5'→3' exoribonuclease; and (iii) remodels the structure of the atpH ribosome-binding site in a manner that can account for PPR10's ability to enhance atpH translation. In addition, we show that the minimal PPR10-binding site spans 17 nt. We propose that the site-specific barrier and RNA remodeling activities of PPR10 are a consequence of its unusually long, high-affinity interface with single-stranded RNA, that this interface provides a functional mimic to bacterial small RNAs, and that analogous activities underlie many of the biological functions that have been attributed to PPR proteins.},

abstract = {The complete sequence of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome revealed thousands of previously unsuspected genes, many of which cannot be ascribed even putative functions. One of the largest and most enigmatic gene families discovered in this way is characterized by tandem arrays of pentatricopeptide repeats (PPRs). We describe a detailed bioinformatic analysis of 441 members of the Arabidopsis PPR family plus genomic and genetic data on the expression (microarray data), localization (green fluorescent protein and red fluorescent protein fusions), and general function (insertion mutants and RNA binding assays) of many family members. The basic picture that arises from these studies is that PPR proteins play constitutive, often essential roles in mitochondria and chloroplasts, probably via binding to organellar transcripts. These results confirm, but massively extend, the very sparse observations previously obtained from detailed characterization of individual mutants in other organisms.},

@article{Pfalz2009,
abstract = {Chloroplast mRNA populations are characterized by overlapping transcripts derived by processing from polycistronic precursors. The mechanisms and functional significance of these processing events are poorly understood. We describe a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein, PPR10, whose binding defines mRNA segments derived from two transcription units in maize chloroplasts. PPR10 interacts in vivo and in vitro with two intergenic RNA regions of similar sequence. The processed 5' and 3' RNA termini in these regions overlap by approximately 25 nucleotides. The PPR10-binding sites map precisely to these overlapping sequences, and PPR10 is required specifically for the accumulation of RNAs with these termini. These findings show that PPR10 serves as a barrier to RNA decay from either the 5' or 3' direction and that a bound protein provides an alternative to an RNA hairpin as a barrier to 3' exonucleases. The results imply that protein 'caps' at both 5' and 3' ends can define the termini of chloroplast mRNA segments. These results, together with recent insights into bacterial RNA decay, suggest a unifying model for the biogenesis of chloroplast transcript populations and for the determinants of chloroplast mRNA stability.},
